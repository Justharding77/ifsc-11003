  <h1>Vegan Pizza</h1> Example (Document Title)

  <h2 id="sample">How to Make My Vegan Pizza</h2> (Primary Content Heading)

  <p>
    This page is about how I make vegan pizza at home. Vegan pizza means there is no meat or dairy, but it can still taste really good.
    The goal is to have a crispy crust, good sauce, and toppings that all work together.
  </p>

  <h3>Ingredients and Setup</h3>
  (Subsection I)

  <p>
    The most important part is the crust. Make sure the dough you use does not have milk, eggs, or honey in it.
    <strong>The sauce is what gives it most of the flavor</strong> so I season mine with garlic and Italian seasoning.
    <em>Vegan cheese melts better than people think</em> if you don’t use too much of it.
    <i>Some store crusts are not vegan so always check.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    For toppings I like mushrooms, spinach, onions, peppers, and olives. You can also use plant-based sausage if you want something heavier.
  </p>

  <!-- This is a list of instructions. -->
  <ol start="5">
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.</li>
    <li>Spread the sauce on the crust.</li>
    <li>Add vegan cheese and toppings, then bake until the crust looks done.</li>
  </ol>

  <!--This is a list of items to purchase at the grocery store. -->
  <ul>
    <li>Pizza dough (vegan)</li>
    <li>Tomato sauce</li>
    <li>Vegan mozzarella</li>
    <li>Vegetables for toppings</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- This is an Example of how we should mark up a term and its description(s) -->
  <dl>
    <dt>Vegan Cheese</dt>
    <dd>A dairy free cheese made from things like nuts or soy.</dd>
    <dd>Used so the pizza still has a cheesy texture without using milk.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h4>Extra Flavor Ideas</h4>

    Good pizza is about balance between the crust, sauce, and toppings.

  <h3>Different Ways to Make It</h3> (Subsection II)

  <p>
    You can change this recipe depending on what you like. A simple version uses sauce, cheese, and basil.
    You can also do a white pizza using a garlic sauce instead of red sauce.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you like spicy food, add jalapeños or chili flakes. If you want more flavor, add olives or sun-dried tomatoes.
    The main thing is to not overload the pizza so everything cooks evenly.
